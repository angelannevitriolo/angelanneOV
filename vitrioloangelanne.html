            <h2>School</h2>
            <p>College for Research and Technology of Cabanatuan (CRT) started as a computer school and has been known to be the first computer school in Nueva Ecija. It pioneered in applying a different approach in education like embedding competency courses to baccalaureate course that even the more established colleges and universities followed. After the main campus was established in 1988 at Cabanatuan City, a strategic plan was laid-out by its president, Dr. Reynato C. Arimbuyutan to establish campuses in all of the four districts of Nueva Ecija. In this way, it was envisioned to contend with the growing desire of students to study in their places of abode but with the quality of education comparable to its main campus. The first Branch established after its Main Campus was the Gapan Branch which opened in 1997. Currently, it is located at Abad Santos Street, Barangay Santo Nino, Gapan City with the hope that the college-owned campus will be built on its lot along Maharlika Highway, Bayanihan, Gapan City in the near future. After three years Guimba Campus was built, located at Parairo St., Saranay Dist., Guimba, Nueva Ecija and followed by San Jose Campus located at Sanchez St., San Jose City. The Gapan, Guimba and San Jose branches are Extension Campuses of the Main Branch that offers two years Technical Courses preparatory to a degree course applying the ladderized education approach.   <or></or></p>
